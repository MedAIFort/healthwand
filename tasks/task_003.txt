# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Python NLP module for context-aware validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a Python module that uses NLP to validate potential PHI matches and reduce false positives
# Details:
Set up a Python project with proper packaging. Implement NLP-based validation using libraries like spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers. Create named entity recognition (NER) models for healthcare-specific entities. Implement context analysis to distinguish between actual PHI and similar patterns. Design a simple API for the Rust CLI to communicate with the Python module. Include pre-trained models for common healthcare terminology. Optimize for performance to minimize impact on scanning speed.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test suite with true and false positive examples. Measure precision and recall metrics. Test with various medical texts to ensure domain-specific accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Python project structure with packaging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a properly structured Python package for the NLP validation module with appropriate dependencies and integration points for Rust
### Details:
Create a Python package named 'phi_nlp_validator' with proper directory structure. Set up pyproject.toml and setup.py with dependencies (spaCy, transformers, numpy, etc.). Create module entry points. Implement a basic API class that will later be exposed to Rust. Set up testing framework with pytest. Document the API interface that will be used by the Rust CLI.

## 2. Implement base NLP pipeline with healthcare models [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up the core NLP pipeline using spaCy or Transformers with pre-trained models suitable for healthcare text
### Details:
Evaluate and select appropriate pre-trained models (consider BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, or Med7). Implement model loading and caching for performance. Create a pipeline class that handles text preprocessing, tokenization, and basic entity recognition. Include healthcare terminology dictionaries. Implement model download/initialization on first use. Add configuration options for model selection and pipeline customization.

## 3. Develop healthcare-specific NER capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement or fine-tune Named Entity Recognition models specifically for healthcare PHI detection
### Details:
Identify key PHI entity types (names, dates, medical record numbers, etc.). Implement rule-based recognizers for structured PHI (e.g., SSNs, phone numbers). Fine-tune NER models on healthcare data if available, or implement ensemble approach combining multiple models. Create entity categorization system that aligns with PHI categories. Add confidence scoring for each entity detection. Implement serialization/deserialization of detected entities.

## 4. Implement context analysis for false positive reduction [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create contextual analysis capabilities to distinguish between actual PHI and similar non-PHI patterns
### Details:
Implement contextual window analysis around potential PHI entities. Create heuristics for common false positive patterns in healthcare text. Use dependency parsing to understand relationships between entities. Implement semantic analysis to identify medical contexts vs. personal information contexts. Create a scoring system that combines entity confidence with contextual indicators. Add configurable thresholds for validation decisions.

## 5. Develop Python-Rust FFI interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Create a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that allows the Rust CLI to efficiently communicate with the Python module
### Details:
Research optimal Python-Rust integration approaches (PyO3, cffi, etc.). Implement serialization/deserialization of data between Rust and Python. Create a simple API with clear entry points for validation requests. Implement error handling and status reporting across language boundary. Add logging and diagnostics. Create examples of how to call the Python module from Rust. Consider performance implications of crossing the language boundary.

## 6. Optimize performance and finalize integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Optimize the NLP module for speed and memory usage, and ensure seamless integration with the main application
### Details:
Profile the module to identify performance bottlenecks. Implement batch processing for multiple validation requests. Add caching mechanisms for frequent patterns. Optimize model loading and inference times. Implement parallel processing where appropriate. Create comprehensive tests with realistic healthcare data. Document performance characteristics and tuning options. Finalize the API and ensure backward compatibility. Create usage examples and integration documentation.
