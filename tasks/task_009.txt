# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement extensibility for custom detection pipelines
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a plugin system that allows users to define and integrate custom detection methods
# Details:
Design a plugin architecture for custom detectors. Implement trait definitions for detector plugins. Create a plugin registry and loading mechanism. Add configuration options for enabling/disabling plugins. Implement example plugins for common use cases. Document the plugin API for third-party developers. Ensure backward compatibility with existing configuration files.

# Test Strategy:
Develop test plugins to verify the extensibility system. Validate that plugins can be enabled/disabled via configuration. Test plugin loading from external files.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define detector plugin trait interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core trait definitions that all detector plugins must implement to be compatible with the system
### Details:
Define a `DetectorPlugin` trait with required methods like `detect()`, `name()`, `version()`, and `configure()`. Include associated types and structures for detection results and configuration options. Ensure the trait is well-documented with examples. Consider error handling, performance characteristics, and thread safety requirements. The trait should be flexible enough to accommodate various detection approaches while maintaining a consistent interface.

## 2. Implement plugin registry and discovery mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a central registry that can discover, load, and manage detector plugins
### Details:
Develop a `PluginRegistry` that maintains a collection of available plugins. Implement dynamic loading capabilities using dynamic libraries (.dll/.so files) or a simpler approach with static registration. Add methods for plugin registration, discovery, and retrieval. Include a plugin validation mechanism to ensure plugins meet the required interface. Implement a caching strategy to avoid repeated loading. Consider thread safety for concurrent access to the registry.

## 3. Add configuration system for plugins [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Extend the existing configuration system to support enabling, disabling, and configuring plugins
### Details:
Modify the configuration file format to include a `plugins` section with enable/disable flags and plugin-specific configuration. Implement configuration parsing and validation for plugin settings. Create a mechanism to pass configuration to plugins during initialization. Ensure backward compatibility by making plugin configurations optional. Add documentation for the new configuration options. Include validation to prevent configuration errors.

## 4. Integrate plugins with the detection pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Modify the main detection pipeline to utilize registered plugins during detection operations
### Details:
Update the detection pipeline to query the plugin registry for available detectors. Implement logic to run detection through both built-in and plugin-based detectors. Add prioritization mechanism to control the order of detector execution. Implement result aggregation from multiple detectors. Add performance monitoring for plugin execution. Ensure error handling so that plugin failures don't crash the entire pipeline.

## 5. Develop example detector plugins [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.4
### Description: Create several example plugins that demonstrate different detection approaches and plugin capabilities
### Details:
Implement at least three example plugins: a simple pattern-based detector, a machine learning-based detector, and a network-based detector. Each example should demonstrate proper implementation of the plugin trait, configuration handling, and effective detection techniques. Include comprehensive comments explaining implementation decisions. Structure the examples as separate modules that can be used as templates by third-party developers. Ensure the examples cover common use cases.

## 6. Create comprehensive plugin development documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Write detailed documentation for third-party developers on how to create and integrate custom detector plugins
### Details:
Produce a plugin development guide covering: plugin interface requirements, lifecycle management, configuration handling, best practices, and deployment instructions. Include step-by-step tutorials for creating basic plugins. Document the plugin discovery process and requirements for plugin distribution. Add API reference documentation with examples. Create troubleshooting guides for common issues. Include performance considerations and security guidelines. Provide templates and starter code that developers can use as a foundation.
