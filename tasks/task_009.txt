# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create compliance reporting module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a reporting system for HIPAA/GDPR compliance audits
# Details:
Design a structured report format for compliance documentation. Implement audit logging of all detection and redaction activities. Create exportable reports in PDF and CSV formats. Add timestamp and user tracking for all operations. Implement report aggregation across multiple scans. Create visualization of PHI detection patterns and hotspots. Support for custom compliance templates based on different regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).

# Test Strategy:
Verify report accuracy against known PHI in test data. Test report generation with large datasets. Validate compliance with sample audit requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement comprehensive audit logging system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust logging mechanism that captures all detection and redaction activities with timestamps and user tracking
### Details:
Develop a centralized logging service that intercepts and records all PHI detection and redaction operations. Each log entry should include: timestamp, user ID, action type (detection/redaction), data source, PHI type identified, action result, and system metadata. Implement proper indexing for efficient querying and ensure logs are tamper-proof. Use a structured format (JSON) for log storage to facilitate later reporting.

## 2. Design structured compliance report formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create standardized report templates for different compliance regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
### Details:
Design a flexible report schema that can accommodate different regulatory requirements. Create base templates for HIPAA and GDPR compliance, with configurable sections for summary statistics, detailed findings, remediation status, and attestation information. Implement a template engine that allows for custom template creation. Each template should define required data points, validation rules, and presentation format. Store templates in a database with versioning support.

## 3. Develop report generation engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Build the core functionality to generate compliance reports from audit logs based on selected templates
### Details:
Implement a report generation service that queries the audit logs, processes the data according to template specifications, and produces structured report objects. Include functionality for filtering by date range, user, data source, and compliance type. Implement data aggregation functions to summarize detection patterns across multiple scans. Ensure the engine handles large datasets efficiently through pagination and background processing for extensive reports.

## 4. Create export functionality for PDF and CSV formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement export capabilities to generate downloadable reports in PDF and CSV formats
### Details:
Develop export adapters for PDF and CSV output formats. For PDF exports, use a PDF generation library to create professional-looking reports with proper formatting, headers/footers, pagination, and the ability to embed charts. For CSV exports, implement proper data structuring and escaping. Both export types should include metadata headers with report generation information. Implement a queuing system for handling large export requests asynchronously.

## 5. Implement data visualization for PHI detection patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Create interactive visualizations showing PHI detection patterns and compliance hotspots
### Details:
Develop data visualization components that illustrate PHI detection patterns and compliance issues. Include heat maps showing concentration of PHI across data sources, trend charts showing detection rates over time, and breakdown charts by PHI type and severity. Implement interactive features allowing users to drill down into specific areas of concern. Ensure visualizations are embeddable in reports and accessible through the reporting dashboard. Use a JavaScript visualization library that supports both interactive web views and static exports for PDF reports.

## 6. Build report aggregation and management interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Create a user interface for managing, viewing, and aggregating compliance reports across multiple scans
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive reporting dashboard that allows users to view, search, filter, and aggregate reports. Implement functionality to combine data from multiple scans into consolidated reports. Include features for scheduling recurring reports, setting up automated exports, and distributing reports to stakeholders. Add administrative controls for managing report access permissions and retention policies. Implement a notification system to alert users about new reports or compliance issues requiring attention.
