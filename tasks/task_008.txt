# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement OCR for image processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Add capability to detect PHI in images using OCR technology
# Details:
Integrate with Tesseract or similar OCR library. Implement image preprocessing to improve OCR accuracy. Support common medical image formats (DICOM, etc.). Create configuration options for OCR sensitivity and accuracy. Implement region-of-interest scanning for targeted processing. Add support for redacting images by blurring or masking detected PHI. Optimize for performance with large images or batches.

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample medical images containing PHI. Measure OCR accuracy on different image qualities. Test performance with large image sets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate OCR library and implement basic image processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Tesseract or similar OCR library and create basic image preprocessing pipeline
### Details:
Add Tesseract OCR as a dependency to the project. Create a service class that handles basic OCR operations. Implement image preprocessing functions including grayscale conversion, noise reduction, thresholding, and contrast enhancement to improve OCR accuracy. Create unit tests to verify OCR functionality with sample images. The preprocessing pipeline should be modular to allow for different preprocessing steps based on image type.

## 2. Add support for medical image formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Extend the OCR service to handle DICOM and other medical image formats
### Details:
Integrate with DICOM processing libraries (like dcm4che) to extract image data from DICOM files. Create format detection logic to automatically identify image formats. Implement appropriate preprocessing for each supported format. Add conversion utilities to transform medical formats into standard formats that can be processed by the OCR engine. Include metadata extraction from medical formats to provide context for PHI detection. Test with a variety of medical image samples.

## 3. Implement PHI detection in OCR results [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create pattern matching and NLP capabilities to identify PHI in OCR-processed text
### Details:
Develop pattern matching algorithms for common PHI types (names, dates, IDs, addresses, etc.). Implement NLP techniques to improve detection accuracy, especially for context-dependent PHI. Create confidence scoring for detected PHI. Add dictionary-based approaches for medical terminology to reduce false positives. Implement region tracking to map detected PHI back to image coordinates. Create a configuration system for adjusting sensitivity thresholds and detection rules.

## 4. Implement region-of-interest scanning and PHI redaction [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Add capability to scan specific image regions and redact detected PHI
### Details:
Create an API for defining regions of interest within images. Implement selective scanning of defined regions to improve performance. Develop redaction methods including blurring, masking, and replacement of detected PHI in images. Ensure redaction preserves image quality outside of PHI areas. Add options for different redaction styles (black box, pixelation, text replacement). Implement preview functionality to review redactions before finalizing. Create audit logging for redaction operations.

## 5. Optimize performance and add configuration options [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Improve processing speed for large images and batches, and finalize configuration system
### Details:
Implement multithreading for parallel processing of images or image regions. Add caching mechanisms to avoid redundant processing. Create batch processing capabilities with progress tracking. Optimize memory usage for large images. Finalize the configuration system with options for OCR engine parameters, sensitivity levels, processing priorities (speed vs. accuracy), and output formats. Add performance monitoring and reporting. Create comprehensive documentation for the OCR system including configuration options and performance tuning guidelines.
