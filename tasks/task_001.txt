# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up Rust project structure and CLI foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Rust project with necessary dependencies and create the basic CLI structure for HealthWand
# Details:
Create a new Rust project using cargo. Set up the project structure with modules for CLI, analyzer, and configuration. Add dependencies for CLI argument parsing (clap), YAML parsing (serde_yaml), and JSON output (serde_json). Implement basic CLI entry point with command-line argument parsing for input files/directories and output format options. Create a simple help menu and version information.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for CLI argument parsing. Manually test the CLI with --help and --version flags to ensure proper output.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Rust project with cargo and add dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Rust project for HealthWand using cargo and add the required dependencies for CLI parsing, YAML processing, and JSON output.
### Details:
Run `cargo new healthwand --bin` to create a new binary project. Update Cargo.toml to add dependencies: clap (with features 'derive') for CLI argument parsing, serde and serde_yaml for YAML configuration handling, and serde_json for JSON output formatting. Also add appropriate version constraints for each dependency. Initialize git repository if not automatically done by cargo.

## 2. Design and implement module structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the foundational module structure for the project, setting up the main components that will be developed further.
### Details:
Create the following module structure: 1) src/main.rs - Entry point that calls the CLI module, 2) src/cli/mod.rs - CLI handling logic, 3) src/analyzer/mod.rs - Stub for future analysis functionality, 4) src/config/mod.rs - Configuration handling. Each module should have appropriate public interfaces and documentation comments. Ensure proper visibility modifiers (pub, pub(crate)) for module items.

## 3. Implement CLI argument parsing with clap [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create the command-line interface structure using clap to handle various input options and commands.
### Details:
In the cli module, use clap's derive feature to define a struct representing CLI arguments. Include options for: input files/directories (--input, -i), output format (--format, -f) with choices like 'json', 'yaml', 'text', verbosity level (--verbose, -v), and any other basic options. Implement a function that parses command line arguments and returns the populated struct. Document each option with helpful descriptions that will appear in the help text.

## 4. Create help menu and version information [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Enhance the CLI with comprehensive help documentation and version information.
### Details:
Configure clap to display detailed help information for all commands and options. Add examples of common usage patterns to the help text. Implement version information that includes the current version from Cargo.toml. Create a custom help formatter that organizes options into logical groups. Test the help menu by running the application with --help and -h flags.

## 5. Implement basic CLI execution flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Connect the CLI argument parsing to a basic execution flow that will serve as the foundation for future functionality.
### Details:
In main.rs, implement the program flow: 1) Parse CLI arguments, 2) Validate inputs, 3) Set up logging based on verbosity, 4) Create placeholder for calling the analyzer (to be implemented later), 5) Add basic output formatting based on the selected format option. Include appropriate error handling for invalid inputs. The program should successfully run and exit with appropriate status codes, even though the analyzer functionality will be implemented in future tasks.
