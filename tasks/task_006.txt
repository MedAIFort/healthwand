# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop GitHub Action integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a GitHub Action that integrates HealthWand into CI/CD pipelines
# Details:
Create GitHub Action definition in YAML format. Implement action.yml with inputs for configuration options. Set up Docker container for the action. Create entrypoint script that runs the CLI tool. Add logic to fail CI/CD pipelines when PHI is detected. Implement customizable threshold settings for pipeline failures. Add support for commenting on PRs with findings summary.

# Test Strategy:
Test the GitHub Action in a sample repository. Verify it correctly identifies PHI in pull requests. Confirm that build failures occur when PHI is detected above the threshold.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GitHub Action definition files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic structure for the GitHub Action with configuration options
### Details:
Create the action.yml file with proper metadata, branding, and input parameters. Define inputs for configuration options like threshold settings, output format, and PR comment options. Include descriptions for each input parameter. Set up the Docker container reference in the action definition. This subtask establishes the interface for the GitHub Action.

## 2. Implement Docker container for the action [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a Docker container that will run the HealthWand CLI tool
### Details:
Create a Dockerfile that installs necessary dependencies and the HealthWand CLI tool. Configure the container environment to handle GitHub Action inputs and outputs. Optimize the container size for faster CI/CD runs. Set up proper entrypoint configuration. Test the Docker build process to ensure it creates a working container.

## 3. Develop entrypoint script with failure logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create the main script that runs the CLI and implements pipeline failure conditions
### Details:
Implement an entrypoint.sh script that processes GitHub Action inputs. Add logic to run the HealthWand CLI with appropriate parameters. Implement customizable threshold settings that determine when to fail the CI/CD pipeline based on PHI detection severity or count. Set up proper exit codes to signal success or failure to GitHub Actions. Include detailed logging for debugging purposes.

## 4. Add PR comment functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement the ability to comment on PRs with a summary of findings
### Details:
Use the GitHub API to post comments on pull requests when PHI is detected. Format the findings in a clear, readable way in the PR comment. Include severity levels, file locations, and remediation suggestions. Add support for customizing the comment format and content based on action inputs. Implement logic to update existing comments rather than creating multiple comments on subsequent runs.
