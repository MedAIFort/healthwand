# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop FastAPI/Uvicorn API server
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a REST API server for real-time PHI detection and redaction
# Details:
Set up a FastAPI project with proper structure. Design RESTful endpoints for PHI detection and redaction. Implement request validation and error handling. Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. Implement authentication and rate limiting. Design asynchronous processing for large files. Create Docker deployment configuration. Implement health checks and monitoring endpoints. Support both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes.

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests using pytest. Test performance under load. Verify correct handling of concurrent requests. Test authentication and authorization mechanisms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up FastAPI project structure with basic configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial FastAPI project structure with proper organization of routes, models, and services
### Details:
Create a project structure with directories for routes, models, services, and utilities. Set up the main.py file with FastAPI initialization. Configure CORS, logging, and basic error handling. Create a configuration system using environment variables. Set up dependency injection framework. Implement basic health check endpoint. Create initial requirements.txt with necessary dependencies.

## 2. Design and implement core PHI detection/redaction endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create the primary REST endpoints for PHI detection and redaction functionality
### Details:
Implement POST /api/v1/detect endpoint for PHI detection in text. Create POST /api/v1/redact endpoint for PHI redaction in text. Design request/response Pydantic models for validation. Implement proper error handling with custom exception classes. Create service layer to separate business logic from route handlers. Add unit tests for endpoint functionality. Document endpoints with appropriate FastAPI annotations.

## 3. Implement authentication and security features [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Add authentication, authorization, and rate limiting to protect API endpoints
### Details:
Implement API key authentication using FastAPI security dependencies. Create middleware for rate limiting based on client IP or API key. Add request logging for security auditing. Implement role-based access control for different endpoint permissions. Create user/API key management endpoints. Add input sanitization to prevent injection attacks. Configure HTTPS/TLS settings. Implement proper security headers.

## 4. Develop asynchronous processing capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create asynchronous processing flow for handling large documents and files
### Details:
Implement background task processing using FastAPI background tasks. Create POST /api/v1/process/async endpoint for submitting async jobs. Implement GET /api/v1/process/status/{job_id} for checking job status. Design job queue system with Redis or similar technology. Create worker processes for handling async jobs. Implement file upload capabilities for processing documents. Add job result storage and retrieval mechanism. Create job cancellation endpoint.

## 5. Create comprehensive API documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Generate detailed API documentation with examples and usage instructions
### Details:
Configure Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with detailed descriptions. Add example requests and responses for all endpoints. Create custom documentation pages for complex workflows. Add authentication documentation with examples. Document error codes and handling. Create Markdown documentation for API usage. Add code samples in multiple languages. Implement ReDoc alternative documentation view.

## 6. Implement deployment configuration and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create Docker deployment setup and monitoring endpoints for production use
### Details:
Create Dockerfile for containerized deployment. Implement docker-compose.yml for local development. Add Kubernetes deployment manifests if needed. Create comprehensive health check endpoints with dependency status. Implement metrics endpoints for Prometheus integration. Add logging configuration for production. Create environment-specific configuration files. Implement graceful shutdown handling. Add load testing scripts to verify performance.
