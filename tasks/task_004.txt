# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate Rust CLI with Python NLP module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the Rust CLI with the Python NLP module to enable context-aware PHI detection
# Details:
Implement PyO3 or similar Rust-Python binding. Create a communication protocol between Rust and Python components. Design a caching mechanism to improve performance for repeated validations. Implement fallback mechanisms for when NLP validation is unavailable. Add configuration options to control NLP usage. Ensure proper error handling for Python exceptions. Create a unified logging system across both components.

# Test Strategy:
Test end-to-end PHI detection with both components. Measure performance impact of NLP integration. Test error handling and recovery scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement PyO3 binding for Python NLP module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up PyO3 in the Rust CLI project and create the initial binding to load and interact with the Python NLP module
### Details:
Add PyO3 dependency to Cargo.toml. Create a Rust module for Python integration. Implement functions to initialize the Python interpreter, import the NLP module, and expose basic NLP functions to Rust. Write tests to verify the Python module can be loaded and basic functions can be called. Handle Python exceptions and convert them to appropriate Rust errors.

## 2. Design and implement communication protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a well-defined interface for data exchange between Rust and Python components
### Details:
Define data structures for requests and responses. Implement serialization/deserialization of these structures between Rust and Python. Create a protocol for batching requests to minimize overhead. Implement timeout mechanisms for Python calls. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring. Document the protocol interface for future reference.

## 3. Implement caching mechanism for NLP results [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create a caching system to store and retrieve previous NLP validation results
### Details:
Design a cache data structure with configurable size limits. Implement cache key generation based on input text and context. Add time-based expiration for cached entries. Create methods for cache lookup, insertion, and invalidation. Implement statistics tracking for cache hits/misses. Add configuration options to control cache behavior. Write tests to verify cache effectiveness.

## 4. Implement fallback mechanisms and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create robust fallback strategies for when NLP validation is unavailable or fails
### Details:
Implement health checks for the Python NLP module. Create a fallback strategy using simpler rule-based detection when NLP is unavailable. Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failures. Implement comprehensive error handling for all Python exceptions. Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures. Create a configuration system to control fallback behavior. Write tests for various failure scenarios.

## 5. Create unified logging and configuration system [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.4
### Description: Implement a consistent logging approach across Rust and Python components with configurable options
### Details:
Create a logging bridge between Rust and Python logging systems. Implement log level synchronization between components. Add structured logging with consistent fields across languages. Create configuration options to control NLP usage, logging verbosity, and performance parameters. Implement configuration reloading without restart. Add telemetry for monitoring integration performance. Document all configuration options and their effects.
