# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement YAML configuration loading
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the configuration system that loads and validates user-defined PHI detection patterns from YAML files
# Details:
Design and implement the configuration data structures to represent PHI patterns. Create a configuration loader that reads YAML files and deserializes them into the configuration model. Implement validation logic to ensure configuration correctness. Include default patterns for common PHI types (SSNs, medical IDs, etc.). Add support for custom pattern definitions with regex patterns, descriptions, and severity levels.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with sample YAML configurations. Test error handling with malformed YAML files. Verify default patterns are loaded correctly when no config is provided.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define configuration data structures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core data models to represent PHI detection patterns and configuration settings
### Details:
Implement classes/structs to represent: 1) PHI pattern with properties for regex pattern, description, severity level, and category; 2) Configuration container class to hold collections of patterns; 3) Enums for severity levels and pattern categories. Include proper documentation and type hints. These models should be designed to map directly to the expected YAML structure while providing a clean API for the rest of the application.

## 2. Implement YAML parser and deserializer [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create functionality to read YAML files and convert them to configuration objects
### Details:
Implement a parser that: 1) Reads YAML files from a specified path; 2) Handles basic YAML parsing errors; 3) Deserializes the YAML content into the configuration data structures created in subtask 1. Use a standard YAML library appropriate for your language. Include error handling for file not found, permission issues, and malformed YAML. The parser should return either valid configuration objects or meaningful error messages.

## 3. Add configuration validation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement validation to ensure loaded configurations meet all requirements
### Details:
Create a validation system that checks: 1) Required fields are present; 2) Regex patterns are valid and compile correctly; 3) Severity levels are within allowed values; 4) No duplicate pattern identifiers exist; 5) References between configuration elements are valid. Implement a validation result object that collects all validation errors rather than failing on the first error. Add unit tests to verify validation logic works correctly for both valid and invalid configurations.

## 4. Create default PHI pattern library [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement a set of default patterns for common PHI types
### Details:
Create a library of default patterns covering: 1) Social Security Numbers (various formats); 2) Medical record numbers; 3) Phone numbers; 4) Email addresses; 5) Names and addresses; 6) Dates of birth; 7) Other common healthcare identifiers. Each pattern should include a well-tested regex, clear description, appropriate severity level, and category. Package these as either a default YAML file or programmatically created default configuration that can be used when no custom configuration is provided.

## 5. Implement configuration manager with merge capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create a central configuration manager that handles loading, validation, and merging configurations
### Details:
Implement a configuration manager class that: 1) Loads configurations from multiple sources (default patterns + user-defined patterns); 2) Validates all configurations using the validation logic; 3) Merges configurations with proper precedence rules (user patterns override defaults when duplicates exist); 4) Provides a clean API for the rest of the application to access validated patterns; 5) Includes proper error handling and logging. Add functionality to reload configurations at runtime and notify dependent components when configuration changes.
