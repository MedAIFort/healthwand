# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement YAML configuration system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a YAML-based configuration system for defining custom PHI patterns and detection rules
# Details:
Design a YAML schema for defining PHI patterns, including regex patterns, context rules, and redaction templates. Implement YAML parsing in Rust using serde. Create a configuration loader that validates and processes the YAML files. Support hierarchical configuration with defaults and overrides. Include documentation templates and examples for common PHI types. Implement hot-reloading of configuration files for development workflows.

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases with various configuration scenarios. Validate that custom patterns are correctly loaded and applied. Test error handling for malformed configurations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design YAML schema for PHI patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive YAML schema that defines the structure for PHI pattern configurations
### Details:
Design a schema that includes: (1) Pattern definitions with regex support, (2) Context rules for determining when patterns apply, (3) Confidence scoring mechanisms, (4) Redaction templates and strategies, (5) Metadata fields for pattern documentation. Create JSON Schema validation rules to ensure configuration correctness. Include examples for common PHI types like names, addresses, medical record numbers, etc. The schema should be extensible for future pattern types while maintaining backward compatibility.

## 2. Implement YAML parsing with serde [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop Rust code to parse and deserialize YAML configuration files using serde
### Details:
Create Rust structs that mirror the YAML schema design. Implement serde derive macros for serialization/deserialization. Add custom validators for complex fields like regex patterns. Implement error handling with descriptive messages for configuration issues. Create unit tests with sample configurations to verify parsing correctness. Ensure performance optimization for large configuration files by using appropriate serde features. Document the mapping between YAML fields and Rust structs.

## 3. Build hierarchical configuration system [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create a configuration management system that supports defaults, overrides, and inheritance
### Details:
Implement a configuration loader that merges multiple YAML files in a defined precedence order. Support default configurations that can be overridden by environment-specific settings. Create a mechanism for pattern inheritance where specific patterns can extend base patterns. Implement configuration validation to ensure merged configurations remain valid. Add support for environment variable substitution within configuration files. Create helper methods to access nested configuration properties with proper error handling. Document the configuration resolution process for users.

## 4. Implement hot-reloading for configuration files [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Add capability to detect and reload configuration changes without application restart
### Details:
Implement a file watcher that monitors configuration files for changes. Create a thread-safe mechanism to reload configurations without disrupting ongoing operations. Add validation to ensure only valid configurations are applied. Implement a notification system to alert components when configurations change. Add configuration versioning to track changes. Create a configuration diff utility to log what changed between reloads. Implement graceful fallback to previous configuration if loading fails. Add metrics to track reload frequency and performance impact.

## 5. Create documentation and examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation and example configurations for the YAML system
### Details:
Create markdown documentation explaining the configuration system architecture. Write a user guide with step-by-step instructions for creating custom PHI patterns. Develop annotated example configurations for common PHI types (names, addresses, phone numbers, medical IDs, etc.). Create a troubleshooting guide for common configuration errors. Document best practices for organizing configuration files. Create a validation tool that users can run to check their configurations. Include performance considerations and optimization tips. Develop integration examples showing how the configuration system connects with the pattern matching engine.
