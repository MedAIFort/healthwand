# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement comprehensive documentation and examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples for all HealthWand components
# Details:
Create comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions. Develop detailed API documentation for all components. Create tutorials for common use cases (CI/CD integration, API usage, custom pattern definition). Provide example configurations for different healthcare scenarios. Create troubleshooting guides and FAQs. Document performance optimization strategies. Include security best practices. Create contribution guidelines for open-source contributors.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for clarity and completeness. Test examples to ensure they work as documented. Gather feedback from potential users on documentation usability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create project README and installation guide [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main project README with clear installation instructions, basic usage examples, and project overview
### Details:
Create a well-structured README.md that includes: project introduction and purpose, badges for build status/coverage, installation instructions for different environments, quick start guide, basic usage examples, license information, and links to more detailed documentation. Include step-by-step installation instructions for different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and deployment options (local, Docker, cloud).

## 2. Develop API documentation for all components [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create comprehensive API documentation for all HealthWand components with clear examples
### Details:
Use a documentation generator (like Sphinx, JSDoc, or similar) to document all public APIs. For each component, document: function signatures, parameter descriptions, return values, exceptions/errors, usage examples, and version compatibility. Organize documentation by component categories (e.g., validators, parsers, integrations). Include diagrams showing component relationships. Set up automated documentation generation in the build process to ensure docs stay current with code changes.

## 3. Create tutorials and use case examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop detailed tutorials for common use cases and example configurations for different healthcare scenarios
### Details:
Create at least 5 detailed tutorials covering: CI/CD integration, API usage patterns, custom pattern definition, integration with EHR systems, and data validation workflows. For each tutorial, include step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and expected outcomes. Develop example configurations for different healthcare scenarios (hospital systems, research institutions, insurance providers, etc.). Package examples as downloadable starter templates. Include screenshots and diagrams where appropriate.

## 4. Develop troubleshooting guides and FAQs [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create comprehensive troubleshooting documentation and frequently asked questions with solutions
### Details:
Compile common issues encountered during development and usage. Create a structured troubleshooting guide organized by component and error type. Include error messages, possible causes, and step-by-step resolution steps. Develop an FAQ section addressing common questions about configuration, performance, security, and integration. Add a decision tree for problem diagnosis. Document performance optimization strategies for different deployment scenarios. Include monitoring and logging best practices.

## 5. Document security best practices and contribution guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create security documentation and guidelines for open-source contributors
### Details:
Document security best practices specific to healthcare data processing: data encryption, access control, audit logging, compliance considerations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.). Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with: code of conduct, development setup instructions, coding standards, pull request process, and issue reporting guidelines. Include documentation on the review process, testing requirements, and documentation standards for contributions. Add templates for bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Document the project's governance model and decision-making process.
