# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy and completeness. Test examples to ensure they work as documented. Gather feedback from potential users on documentation clarity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create project README with overview and quick start guide [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive README.md file that introduces the project and provides quick start instructions
### Details:
Create a README.md with sections for: project overview, features, installation instructions, basic usage examples, license information, and contribution guidelines.

## 2. Document CLI usage and configuration file format [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create detailed documentation for all CLI commands, options, and configuration file structure
### Details:
Create a CLI.md document that lists all available commands with syntax, options, flags, and examples. For the configuration file, document the schema, required and optional fields, default values, and validation rules. Include at least 3 complete configuration examples for different use cases. Use tables for command options and JSON/YAML examples for configuration.

## 3. Develop API documentation with request/response examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create comprehensive API reference documentation with example requests and responses
### Details:
Document each API endpoint with HTTP method, URL, request parameters, headers, authentication requirements, response codes, and response schema. Include curl examples for each endpoint and sample responses in JSON format. Group endpoints logically by resource or functionality. Include error handling information and rate limiting details if applicable.

## 4. Create GitHub Action usage guide and CI/CD integration examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Document how to use the tool as a GitHub Action and integrate with various CI/CD pipelines
### Details:
Create a GitHub-Actions.md guide with step-by-step instructions for setting up the GitHub Action. Include example workflow YAML files for different scenarios. For CI/CD integration, provide examples for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and CircleCI. Include configuration snippets and explanations of environment variables and secrets management.

## 5. Document extension points and plugin development [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create developer documentation for extending the tool and building plugins
### Details:
Create a Developers.md guide that documents the architecture, extension points, and plugin system. Include class diagrams, interface definitions, and the plugin lifecycle. Provide a step-by-step tutorial for creating a simple plugin with code examples. Document the plugin API, events, and hooks. Include information on testing plugins and contribution guidelines.

## 6. Create compliance reference documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Document how the tool helps with compliance for HIPAA, GDPR, HITRUST, and other frameworks
### Details:
Create a Compliance.md document that explains how the tool maps to specific requirements in HIPAA, GDPR, and HITRUST. Include tables showing requirement IDs, descriptions, and how the tool addresses each one. Provide configuration examples specifically tailored for compliance scanning. Include disclaimer about not guaranteeing compliance and recommendation to consult legal experts.

## 7. Set up documentation website with navigation and search [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Implement a documentation website using mdBook or similar tool with proper organization
### Details:
Select and set up a documentation tool (mdBook recommended). Organize all documentation into a logical structure with chapters and sections. Implement navigation, table of contents, and search functionality. Ensure mobile-friendly design. Set up automated deployment of the documentation site when documentation files change. Include syntax highlighting for code examples and a dark/light mode toggle.
