      "taskTitle": "Set up Rust project structure and CLI foundation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the steps required to initialize a new Rust project, set up a modular project structure with separate modules for CLI, analyzer, and configuration, add dependencies for argument and data parsing, and implement a basic CLI entry point with help/version commands.",
      "reasoning": "While foundational, this task is straightforward for experienced Rust developers. It involves standard project setup, dependency management, and basic CLI scaffolding, but requires attention to best practices in module organization and CLI usability[1][2][3][4][5]."

      "taskTitle": "Implement YAML configuration loading",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to design configuration data structures, implement YAML file loading and deserialization, validate user-defined PHI patterns, provide default patterns, and support custom regex-based pattern definitions.",
      "reasoning": "This task introduces more complexity due to the need for robust data modeling, error handling, and validation logic. Supporting extensible, user-defined patterns and ensuring configuration correctness adds to the challenge."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop regex-based PHI detection engine",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement the PHI analyzer using regex patterns, design data structures for findings, develop recursive file traversal, add filtering and multi-threading for performance, and implement context capture for detected PHI.",
      "reasoning": "This is a core, high-complexity task involving efficient file I/O, regex application, concurrency, and extensibility. Handling large codebases and ensuring accurate, performant detection requires careful design and testing."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create JSON reporting system",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Enumerate the steps to design a JSON schema for findings, implement report generation and summary statistics, include detailed context in output, support verbosity levels, and handle output to file or stdout.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, requiring thoughtful data serialization, flexible output formatting, and user-configurable reporting. Ensuring compatibility and clarity in reports is important for downstream integration."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement PHI redaction and anonymization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of redaction and anonymization strategies, in-place file modifications with backups, redaction modes per PHI type, CLI options for redaction, and atomic file operations.",
      "reasoning": "This task is challenging due to the need for safe, accurate file modifications, multiple redaction strategies, and robust error handling to prevent data loss or corruption."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop GitHub Action integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to define the GitHub Action YAML, set up a Docker container, implement the entrypoint script, handle CI/CD failure logic, and support PR commenting with findings.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with GitHub Actions involves cross-domain knowledge (YAML, Docker, CI/CD), but leverages existing CLI functionality. The main challenges are robust automation and clear feedback in CI environments."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Build RESTful API server with Actix Web",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to set up Actix Web, implement REST endpoints for PHI detection, design request/response models, add authentication and rate limiting, generate API documentation, and add health/metrics endpoints.",
      "reasoning": "Building a secure, documented, and performant API server is complex, requiring expertise in web frameworks, security, API design, and integration with core detection logic."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Add basic NLP context-aware detection",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of an NLP library, implementation of named entity recognition, confidence scoring, false positive rules, context window analysis, and configuration for optional NLP features.",
      "reasoning": "Adding NLP-based detection increases complexity due to dependency management, integration with existing detection logic, and the need for configurable, efficient context analysis."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to design a plugin architecture, define traits for detector plugins, implement plugin loading and registry, add configuration for plugins, provide example plugins, and document the plugin API.",
      "reasoning": "Designing a robust, safe, and user-friendly plugin system is complex, requiring careful API design, dynamic loading, and backward compatibility considerations."
