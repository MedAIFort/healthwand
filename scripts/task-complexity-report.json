    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up Rust CLI foundation with basic PHI detection",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating a Rust CLI for PHI detection into subtasks such as project initialization, argument parsing, regex-based PHI pattern matching, file traversal, JSON output formatting, redaction logic, and error handling/logging.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires setting up a robust CLI in Rust, integrating argument parsing (using clap or structopt), implementing regex-based PHI detection, file traversal, JSON output, and redaction. Each component is standard but must be well-integrated and robust, making the task moderately complex. Best practices in CLI design, error handling, and modularity are essential.[1][2][4][5]"

      "taskTitle": "Implement YAML configuration system",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to design and implement a YAML-based configuration system in Rust, including schema design, YAML parsing, validation, hierarchical config support, documentation/example creation, and hot-reloading.",
      "reasoning": "Designing a flexible YAML schema for PHI patterns, integrating serde for parsing, supporting hierarchical configs, and implementing hot-reloading introduces significant complexity. Ensuring validation, extensibility, and clear documentation are key challenges, especially for user-defined detection rules."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Python NLP module for context-aware validation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to build a Python NLP module for PHI validation, including project setup, NER model development, context analysis implementation, API design for Rust integration, model packaging, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves advanced NLP (NER, context analysis), integration with Rust, and performance considerations. Developing or adapting healthcare-specific models and ensuring reliable, fast validation is challenging and requires expertise in both NLP and system integration."

    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Rust CLI with Python NLP module",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Enumerate the steps to connect a Rust CLI with a Python NLP module, covering Rust-Python bindings, communication protocol, caching, fallback/error handling, configuration, and unified logging.",
      "reasoning": "Cross-language integration (Rust and Python) is inherently complex, especially with performance, error handling, and logging across boundaries. Designing robust communication and fallback mechanisms adds to the challenge."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement structured data scanning (JSON, CSV)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of adding structured data scanning to the CLI, including JSON/CSV parsing, path/column-based scanning, configuration for field selection, FHIR resource detection, nested structure support, and output preservation.",
      "reasoning": "Parsing and scanning structured data formats, supporting configuration-driven field selection, and handling nested data structures require careful design but are well-supported by existing libraries. Preserving structure in redacted outputs adds moderate complexity."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to integrate the tool with GitHub Actions, including action definition, Docker environment setup, input/output parameter design, PR comment/reporting, file ignore support, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "While integrating with GitHub Actions and Docker is straightforward, ensuring seamless CI/CD integration, flexible configuration, and robust reporting requires attention to detail but is less technically complex than core detection logic."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop FastAPI/Uvicorn API server",
      "complexityScore": 8,

      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to build a FastAPI server for PHI detection, including project setup, endpoint design, request validation, OpenAPI documentation, authentication/rate limiting, async processing, Docker deployment, and health monitoring.",
      "reasoning": "Building a scalable, secure API server with FastAPI involves multiple concerns: endpoint design, async processing, authentication, documentation, and deployment. Supporting both sync/async modes and robust error handling increases complexity."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to build a compliance reporting module, including report format design, audit logging, export functionality, timestamp/user tracking, aggregation, visualization, and support for custom templates.",
      "reasoning": "Developing a comprehensive reporting system for compliance involves structured report generation, audit logging, export formats, aggregation, and visualization. Supporting multiple regulations and templates adds significant complexity."
